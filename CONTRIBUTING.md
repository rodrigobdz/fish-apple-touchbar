# Contributing to fish-apple-touchbar

If you're interested in contributing to fish-apple-touchbar, hopefully this document makes the process for contributing clear.

## Get involved

There are many ways to contribute, and many of them do not involve writing any code. Here's a few ideas to get started:

- Look through the [open issues](https://github.com/rodrigobdz/fish-apple-touchbar/issues). Provide workarounds, ask for clarification, or suggest labels.
- If you find an issue you would like to fix, [open a pull request](https://github.com/rodrigobdz/fish-apple-touchbar/pulls).
  For non-doc fixes:
- Provide changelog entry in the [unreleased section of the CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/rodrigobdz/fish-apple-touchbar/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#unreleased).
- Ensure CI passes and that you added a test that passes with the fix and fails without the fix.
- Squash all commits down to one with a nice commit message _ONLY_ once final review is given. Make sure this single commit is rebased on top of master.
- Please address all code review comments.
- Ensure that docs are updated accordingly if a feature is added.

### Commit Messages

From [How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

#### The seven rules of a great git commit message

> Keep in mind: This has all been said before.

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

## Reporting Issues

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/rodrigobdz/fish-apple-touchbar/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.
If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

- 👍 - upvote
- 👎 - downvote
  If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.
Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.
The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

## Pull requests

### Your first pull request

So you have decided to contribute code back to upstream by opening a pull request. You've invested a good chunk of time, and we appreciate it. We will do our best to work with you and get the PR looked at.
